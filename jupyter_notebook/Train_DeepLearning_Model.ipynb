    "# About the notebook\n",
    "This notebook is designed to train a deep learning UNET architecture for segmenting and detecting structures in a 2D input image. The [UNET architecture](https://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/ronneber/u-net/) is a popular choice for image segmentation tasks and it is composed of an encoder path, which extracts high-level features, and a decoder path, which takes the features extracted by the encoder path and generates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook is intended to be user-friendly, intuitive and does not require any programming skills to train the model. The user only needs to provide a training set consisting of input images and their corresponding target masks (also called ground truth images). The input images represent the images that will be segmented, while the target images contain the desired segmentation mask for each input image.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Training dataset requirements:** To use the notebook, the user needs to provide the paths of the folders containing the input and target images. These folders should be organized in such a way that each input image has a corresponding target image with the same file name. For example, if the input image is named \"image_001.tif\", then the corresponding target image should be named \"image_001_target.tif\". **Please note that the current version of the notebook only accepts images in the TIF file format**. \n",
    "<br> *The input image* is required to be in a specific shape, which is \\[C1,H,W\\], where C1 is the number of channels, and H and W are the height and width of the image, respectively. This means that if the input image contains multiple channels, such as a RGB image, the channels should be included in a single file in the specified shape. \n",
    "<br> *The target image* should have the shape \\[C2,H,W\\], where C2 corresponds to the different objects to be segmented. The target image should be a binary image, where each object to be segmented is represented by a separate binary mask. The value of 1 in the mask corresponds to the object to be detected, and 0 corresponds to the background. It is important to note that the number of channels in the input image and the number of objects to segment in the target image may vary depending on the specific task and the dataset being used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the model is trained, the notebook \"Predict_Using_Model.ipynb\" can be used to generate segmentation masks for new input images. This can be done by providing a new set of input images and running the trained model on these images."

    "Data augmentation is a technique commonly used in machine learning to increase the size and variability of a training set by applying various transformations to the original data. These transformations may include flips, rotations, zooms, and shears, among others. The goal of data augmentation is to provide the model with additional training data that captures different variations of the same object, thereby improving the model's ability to generalize to new datasets.\n",
